# Description
Horiseon needed some help updating their website to meet accessibility standards to keep it optimized for search engines. They also needed me to clean up some of the source code and fix a couple of broken elements.

## Here's a list of some of the specific changes that were made

* Fixed broken nav links
* Added alt text to all images that were missing alt text
* Added description to title element
* Stylized nav links with hover effect (bonus!)
* Consolidated and organized style.css file
* Increased legibility of source code

The following image demonstrates the updated accessibility:
